BeCode project : HTML - SCSS - JS consolidation

## Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical HTTP flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the HTTP requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api

## Specifications

### ðŸŒ± Must haves
- In the home page the user can enter the city of their choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
ðŸ’¡ Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves (in no specific order)
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
- Allow the user to compare the weather in multiple cities simultaneously
- Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.
- Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js

## Instructions
- Create an account on OpenWeather, and generate a key
- Get the weather data using the native JS fetch() method.


## Technology

- Vite.js
- SASS SCSS
